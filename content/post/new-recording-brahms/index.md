I was recently invited to participate in the Chamber Music Intensive at the Pasadena Conservatory of Music, preparing and then performing Brahms's G Major string sextet over the course of one week. I am happy to note that a recording of the final performance is available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znwhO3zSTdA.
