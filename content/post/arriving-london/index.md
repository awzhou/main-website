I am now several days into my semester abroad in London studying viola performance at the Royal College of Music. It's certainly been an interesting time to arrive here, given the Queen's recent passing. The College's building flies a British flag at half staff, and the main entry is draped in black. A portrait of the Queen and commemorative text flank the main entry, and the plaque celebrating her Diamond Jubilee at the top of the stairs across the street by Royal Albert Hall is surrounded by several bouquets. 

Given the national period of mourning, the "fresher's week" social activities have largely been rescheduled or scaled back. Notably, the remaining social events no longer serve alcohol. Despite this, the past few days have been a whirlwind of auditions, information sessions, speeches, meet-and-greets, and even some rehearsals. It's been very exhausting — though not in a bad way — and I'm hoping that has to do with the fluidity and somewhat chaotic nature of this week, rather than this foreshadowing how the remainder of the term will pass.

Regular classes — modules — begin on Tuesday, as the College will be closed on Monday for the Queen's funeral. So far, I have only been enrolled in one module, though I anticipate that changing come Friday, when us Princeton people have our dedicated induction meeting with the person overseeing our exchange, which is somewhat flippantly called the "Princeton University *Experience*".

I've met many people over the past few days, though unfortunately, I cannot recall the vast majority of their names. The induction week activities involve a lot of mixing of different students, so we've talked to other undergraduates as well as some graduate students ("post-grads"). Interestingly, we have yet to run into any students from the Boston University exchange, which is the other American one.

Getting to and from the College has been quite the experience, and it makes me appreciate being able to live on campus. Prince Consort Village, the RCM's hall of residence, sits about forty minutes away from the College by bus or train. While not bad, it does add up in terms of paying for fares and having to travel across town with a bag, instrument, and other necessities.

As classes begin and things settle down, I'll be back with some more thoughts and reflections.
