My current research in the [Parker Lab](https://beetles.caltech.edu) at Caltech aims to further develop CRISPR-based gene editing tools in rove beetles. Specifically, I am working with the emerging model organism *Dalotia coriaria*, also known as the greenhouse rove beetle. By increasing our capability to perform genetic manipulations in *Dalotia*, which is a free-living rove beetle, this work will enable the lab to further its understanding of how some species of rove beetles have evolved obligate symbiotic relationships with ants that allow them to infiltrate ant colonies and benefit from the colonies' resources.

For my senior thesis research in the [Gavis Lab](https://gavislab.scholar.princeton.edu) at Princeton, I demonstrated novel contributions of an RNA-binding protein to germline development in *Drosophila melanogaster*. This work improves our understanding of RNA biology and posttranscriptional regulation in the *Drosophila* germline, with broader implications for gene regulation in other systems.
