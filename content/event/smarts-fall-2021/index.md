Trenton Arts at Princeton (TAP) presents its Fall 2021 showcase of the Saturday Morning Arts (SMArts) groups, the Trenton Youth Dancers, Orchestra, Singers, and Theater. This event was originally scheduled for 04 December 2021 but has been tentatively postponed to 12 February 2022 due to health and safety concerns arising from a recent uptick in campus COVID-19 cases.
